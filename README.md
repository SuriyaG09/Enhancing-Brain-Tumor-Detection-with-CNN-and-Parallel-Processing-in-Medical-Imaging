# Brain Tumor Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and parallel processing techniques. Early detection of brain tumors is crucial for better patient outcomes, and this project leverages deep learning to automate and enhance the detection process.

- Improve diagnostic accuracy compared to manual interpretation.
- Reduce the time and cost associated with human interpretation.
- Enhance patient outcomes through early detection.

## Data Preparation

### Dataset
For this project, we utilized the [Brain Tumor Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection) available on Kaggle. This dataset contains a collection of MRI scans for brain tumor detection.

### Data Source
The dataset was collected and made available by [Ahmed H. Hamada](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedhamada0). We express our gratitude for providing this valuable resource for our research.

### Data Preprocessing
Prior to training and testing our Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we performed data preprocessing steps, including data augmentation, normalization, and image resizing. Details of the preprocessing pipeline can be found in the [preprocessing script](link-to-your-preprocessing-script.ipynb).

### Data Splitting
We split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to train our models and evaluate their performance. The specific data splitting ratios are detailed in our [data splitting script](link-to-your-data-splitting-script.ipynb).
